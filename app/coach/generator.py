"""Phase 4.3 — deterministic, no-LLM workout generator. Two independent paths per
(user, date), both gated by one shared stats.readiness() result:

- Endurance: goal-driven periodization (phase from a race goal's date, weekly mileage
  ramp capped by phase, readiness-gated intensity downgrade, a distribution audit,
  two-a-days in build/peak).
- Strength (Phase 4.4 follow-on): a small hardcoded exercise-rotation template,
  readiness-gated, with double-progression state in ExerciseProgress.

Both paths are idempotent per (user, date): each only ever creates/updates its own
`source="generator"` Workout rows, never touching a "coach" (manual/chat-scheduled)
or "garmin" (adaptive-plan) row for the same date — mirrors coach.py's
sync_garmin_suggested_workouts, the one existing precedent for exactly this kind of
per-source-per-date upsert.

Known v1 approximations, called out explicitly rather than silently:
- `WeeklyPlan.target_tss`/`actual_tss` store a mileage-based proxy, not a real
  Training Stress Score (Phase 6.1's per-activity TSS hasn't shipped yet) — same
  "real number now, real thing later" tradeoff stats.readiness()'s acuteChronicRatio
  already makes.
- The distribution audit approximates "time-in-zone" with a coarse hard/easy day-type
  ratio (tempo/interval count as hard) over the trailing 7 days, not true per-second
  HR-zone time (this app doesn't store zone-time breakdowns at sync time).
- The strength exercise template is a small, hardcoded 2-day A/B full-body rotation
  (see STRENGTH_TEMPLATES) — not a real exercise-library/selection system.
