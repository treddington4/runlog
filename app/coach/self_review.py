"""Phase 12.5 — maintains one rolling draft GitHub issue per user (CoachIssueDraft),
accumulated from two sources: this module's own periodic historical review (a one-shot
Claude call over real, non-test chat history since the last checkpoint, looking for
coach bugs/gaps), and assistant.py's live log_product_feedback tool (a message
classified as a bug report/feature request/product feedback about HALE itself, logged
immediately rather than waiting for the next scheduled review). Deliberately draft-only
— never auto-posts to github.com, see CLAUDE.md.

The document itself is meant to be handed to an LLM (a future Claude Code session) to
actually act on — organized by topic/area with synthesized, comprehensible problem
statements, not a chronological log of dated, quoted entries. See _MERGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT."""
